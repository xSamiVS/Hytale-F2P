## 📌 Versioning Policy

**⚠️ Important: Semantic Versioning Required**

This project follows **strict semantic versioning** with **numerical versions only**:

- ✅ **Valid**: `2.0.1`, `2.0.11`, `2.1.0`, `3.0.0`
- ❌ **Invalid**: `2.0.2b`, `2.0.2a`, `2.0.1-beta`, `v2.0.2b`

**Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.0.11`)

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

**Why?** The auto-update system requires semantic versioning for proper version comparison. Letter suffixes (like `2.0.2b`) are not supported and will cause update detection issues.
